# Invoice app solution - Lvl 5 Challenge

This is a solution to the [Invoice app challenge on Frontend Mentor - Max Level Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
